Hey there! Thanks for checking out my shining new site made with Jekyll :)     
I'm a somewhat inexperienced developer who mostly worked with VoIP technology, but I quickly realized my industry experience was not enough to keep me afloat through the next decade, decided to study Ruby on Rails framework with a wonderful mentor Eliot Sykes. He's an awesome teacher and taught me everything I know about frontend development.  

####My goal for the near future is to be out and about wrecking havoc on the internet.
